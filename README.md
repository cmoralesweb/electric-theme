Electric Theme
===

This is Electric Theme, by Carlos Morales ( http://cmorales.es ). The theme is inspired by electric cars design: round and soft, white, blue, green... and based upon the _underscore theme by Automatic

This theme includes an options panel, so you can set everything to your taste and remove stuff you don't need/want. All the theme was created that way, that's why some funcionality comes separated as a plugin.

The plugins are in wp-content/plugins and the theme itself is in wp-content/theme ... nothing too complicated, right?

The CSS was created with SASS, so you can customize it like a CSS-guru if you want. All those files are in the SASS directory within the theme. Otherwise, you can just edit the style.css file as you'd regularly do.
